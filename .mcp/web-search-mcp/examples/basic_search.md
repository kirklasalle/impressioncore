# Web Search MCP Basic Usage Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Web Search MCP server for research with proper citations.

## Python Client Example

```python
import requests
import json

# Server configuration
MCP_SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:8765"

def search_with_citations(query, num_results=5):
    """
    Perform a web search with citations using the MCP server
    
    Args:
        query: Search query string
        num_results: Number of results to return
        
    Returns:
        JSON response with search results and citations
    """
    # Prepare the request
    endpoint = f"{MCP_SERVER_URL}/search"
    payload = {
        "query": query,
        "num_results": num_results,
        "require_citations": True
    }
    
    # Send the request
    response = requests.post(endpoint, json=payload)
    
    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
        print(response.text)
        return None

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    query = "impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare"
    results = search_with_citations(query)
    
    if results:
        print(f"Found {len(results['results'])} results for '{query}'")
        print("\nResults with citations:")
        
        for i, result in enumerate(results['results'], 1):
            print(f"\n--- Result {i} ---")
            print(f"Title: {result['title']}")
            print(f"URL: {result['url']}")
            print(f"Summary: {result['content'][:150]}...")
            print(f"Citation: {result['citation']}")
```

## Using with an AI Assistant

When requesting information from an AI assistant, you can ask it to use the MCP server to perform research:

```
Can you research the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare using the MCP server for accurate and cited information?
```

The AI can then make requests to the MCP server, gather the information, and provide a well-researched response with proper citations.
